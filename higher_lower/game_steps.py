-----------------------------Higher Or Lower-----------------------------
Inspiration: 
This game is basically inspired from the online higher or lower game, in which the user can play the game and guess the number of searches for a particular topic. 

Basic Rules:- 
If the guessed answer (only 2 options, higher or lower), is right, your score will be incremented by 1, and the game continues ahead. Otherwise the game is over, and final score is displayed. 
Here if you guess the correct one, you have to compare the next one to this one's number of guesses. 

Modification:
Here instead of searches, we are comparing the number of followers. 

Example output:
    __  ___       __             
   / / / (_)___ _/ /_  ___  _____
  / /_/ / / __ `/ __ \/ _ \/ ___/

Steps to be performed:- 
1. Import random, data.py, and logo.py

3. Define game_logic() - 
Define the initial score as zero. (in game_logic())
4. Define continue_game = True

5. Create select_random()
You can select random number using randint from 0 to len(data) and print details about the same using list and dictionaries methods.
return the following data - name, follower_count, description, country as a dictionary

6. While continue_game:
    print logo
    8. If the initial score is zero, 
        7. Randomly select one person/one data entry from the list of data. (make a function for the same select_random()) (in game_logic()) - save as p1 dictionary
        select one more person/one data entry. (using select_random()) (in game_logic()) - save as p2 dictionary
    9. If score >=1 : 
        Display the foll - You're right! Your current score is : score
        Display the initial person/one data entry. (in game_logic())
        Select one more person/one data entry. (in game_logic()) save as p2 dictionary
    10. Print 1st person/one data entry --> print vs logo --> print second one person/data entry. (in game_logic())
    11. Take user input for selecting higher or lower. (in game_logic())
    12. If the answer is right, 
        increment the score by 1 (in game_logic())
        person 1 = person 2
        person 2 = {}
    13. If the answer is wrong,
        continue_game = False
        clear screen 
        print logo
        print - Sorry, that's wrong. Final score: 1
